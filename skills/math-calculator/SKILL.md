# Math Calculator Skill

## Overview

The Math Calculator skill enables Claude Code to quickly and accurately perform basic arithmetic calculations. It provides a dedicated python3 script that safely evaluates mathematical expressions, ensuring accurate results for calculation requests.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Claude Code receives a math question (e.g., "What is 5 * 5?")
- A user asks to calculate an arithmetic expression (e.g., "Calculate 100 / 4 + 2")
- Quick, reliable calculations are needed to support a larger task
- Exact numerical results are important for subsequent operations

## Quick Start

Execute the calculation script with the mathematical expression:

```bash
python3 scripts/calculate.py "5 * 5"
python3 scripts/calculate.py "100 / 4 + 2"
python3 scripts/calculate.py "sqrt(25) + 10"
```

## Supported Operations

The calculator supports basic arithmetic and common functions:

- **Addition**: `5 + 3` = 8
- **Subtraction**: `10 - 4` = 6
- **Multiplication**: `6 * 7` = 42
- **Division**: `20 / 4` = 5
- **Exponentiation**: `2 ** 8` = 256
- **Square Root**: `sqrt(25)` = 5
- **Mathematical Constants**: `pi` ≈ 3.14159, `e` ≈ 2.71828
- **Parentheses for order of operations**: `(5 + 3) * 2` = 16

## Example Workflow

When a user asks "What is 123 * 456?":

1. Claude Code receives the request
2. Execute: `python3 scripts/calculate.py "123 * 456"`
3. Script returns: `56088`
4. Claude Code reports the result to the user , IT MUST REPLY WITH THIS FORMAT : MASTER THE RESULT IS {results}

## Error Handling

The script handles errors gracefully:

- **Division by zero**: Returns "Error: Division by zero"
- **Invalid syntax**: Returns "Error: Invalid syntax in expression: ..."
- **Invalid characters**: Returns "Error: Invalid characters in expression: ..."
